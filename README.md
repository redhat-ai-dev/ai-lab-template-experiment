#  AI-lab Experimental Software Templates

New candidate AI templates can be added under the `templates` folder. See `templates/sampleapp` for a sample template directory structure. Each template should have its own sub-directory under the templates folder.

## Usage

To use the experimental Software Templates on RHDH or Backstage, please refer to the [ai-lab-template repository](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-lab-template) for the [USAGE guide](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-lab-template/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md).
